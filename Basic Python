I've been practicing Python in Tryhackme and will do this project on Ubuntu virtual machine. THM room is called Python Basics. I mainly use virtualbox for all my virtual machines. I will follow along the Python basic from Tryhackme, but will not use the examples they have.

Resources Used:
-https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
-https://ubuntu.com/#download
-https://www.python.org/downloads/
-https://tryhackme.com/room/pythonbasics
-Bro Code Data Types https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKFrQXaoSMQ

Environments Used:
-Ubuntu in Virtualbox

Started Ubuntu virtual machine and open a terminal. Type 'python3' to open python. Screenshots are provided.

1. Print 'Hello World'

Print: Output the text 
Note: Make sure to add quotation marks!
Example 1: Typed print("Hello World") and it should show 'Hello World'
Example 2: Typed print("It's a rainy day") and it should show 'It's a rainy day'

2. Mathematical Operators

We can code a calculator to use mathematical operators and comparison operators. 
Mathematical Operators: 
-Additon (+)
-Subtraction (-)
-Mulitiplication (*)
-Division (/)
-Modulus (%)
-Exponents (**)

Comparison Operators: 
-Greater Than (>)
-Less Than (<)
-Equal To (==)
-Not Equal To (!=)
-Greater Than or Equal to (>=)
-Less Than or Equal (<=)

Mathematical Operators Examples: Screenshot https://imgur.com/qeFretg
Example 1: Typed >>> print(100+50) and it should show 150 
Example 2: Typed >>> print(620-240) and it should show 380  
Example 3: Typed >>> print(78*2) and it should show 156  
Example 4: Typed >>> print(100/5) and it should show 20.0  
Example 5: Typed >>> print(30%6) and it should show 0  
Example 6: Typed >>> print(8**2) and it should show 64  

Comparison Operators Examples:
Typed b = 24, hit space, and typed r = 25. This will tell python what the letter associate with the number. It should look like this below. Screenshot: https://imgur.com/wfjLdwT
>>> b = 24
>>> r = 25
>>> print(b > r)
False
>>> print(b < r)
True
>>> print(b == r)
False
>>> print(b != r)
True
>>> print(b >= r)
False
>>> print(b <= r)
True

3. Variable and Data Types
Variables allow you to store and update data in a computer program. You have a variable name and store data to that name. Data Types is the type of data being stored in a variable.
>>> Food = "hot dog"
>>> Money = 24000

Data Types:
String - Used for combinations of characters, such as letters or symbols
Integer - Whole numbers
Float - Numbers that contain decimal points or for fractions
Boolean - Used for data that is restricted to True or False options
List - Series of different data types stored in a collection

Variable Examples: Screenshot https://imgur.com/hmZpBzw
>>> size = 9
>>> size = size + 1
>>> print(size)
10

Data Types Example: 

String Concatenation: https://imgur.com/dXxcaN3
>>> age = 40
>>> print("You will be " + str(age) + " years old tomorrow")
You will be 40 years old tomorrow

other separate arguments: https://imgur.com/NFJ1TSr
>>> age = 40
>>> print("You will be", age, "years old tomorrow")
You will be 40 years old tomorrow

>>> age = 40
>>> print(f"You will be {age} years old tomorrow")
You will be 40 years old tomorrow

Integer: https://imgur.com/aAWQm1A
>>> players = 10
>>> print(f"There are {players} players in the basketball game")
There are 10 players in the basketball game

Float: https://imgur.com/yVfNcRi
>>> price = 100.99
>>> print(f"The price is ${price} for your groceries")
The price is $100.99 for your groceries

Boolean: 
>>>
>>>
