I've been practicing Python in Tryhackme and will do this project on Ubuntu virtual machine. THM room is called Python Basics. I mainly use virtualbox for all my virtual machines. I will follow along the Python basic from Tryhackme, but will not use the examples they have.

Resources Used:
-https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
-https://ubuntu.com/#download
-https://www.python.org/downloads/
-https://tryhackme.com/room/pythonbasics

Environments Used:
-Ubuntu in Virtualbox

Started Ubuntu virtual machine and open a terminal. Type 'python3' to open python. Screenshots are provided.

1. Print 'Hello World'

Print: Output the text 
Note: Make sure to add quotation marks!
Example 1: Typed print("Hello World") and it should show 'Hello World'
Example 2: Typed print("It's a rainy day") and it should show 'It's a rainy day'

2. Mathematical Operators

We can code a calculator to use mathematical operators and comparison operators. 
Mathematical Operators: 
-Additon (+)
-Subtraction (-)
-Mulitiplication (*)
-Division (/)
-Modulus (%)
-Exponents (**)

Comparison Operators: 
-Greater Than (>)
-Less Than (<)
-Equal To (==)
-Not Equal To (!=)
-Greater Than or Equal to (>=)
-Less Than or Equal (<=)

Mathematical Operators Examples:
Example 1: Typed print("100+50=150") and it should show 100+50=150. Screenshot: https://imgur.com/6FeVcB0
Example 2: Typed print("620-240=380") and it should show 620-240=380. Screenshot: https://imgur.com/axouYCa
Example 3: Typed print("78*2=156") and it should show 78*2=156. Screenshot: https://imgur.com/sR3sYnn
Example 4: Typed print("100/5=20") and it should show 100/5=20. Screenshot: https://imgur.com/TxVs2up
Example 5: Typed print("30%6=0") and it should show 30%6=0. Screenshot: https://imgur.com/tXTVUza
Example 6: Typed print("8**2=64") and it should show 8**2=64. Screenshot: https://imgur.com/KqIvhsh

Comparison Operators:
Typed b = 24, hit space, and typed r = 25. This will tell python what the letter associate with the number. It should look like this below. Screenshot: https://imgur.com/wfjLdwT
>>> b = 24
>>> r = 25
>>> print(b > r)
False
>>> print(b < r)
True
>>> print(b == r)
False
>>> print(b != r)
True
>>> print(b >= r)
False
>>> print(b <= r)
True
